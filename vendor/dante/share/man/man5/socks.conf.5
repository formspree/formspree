.TH SOCKS.CONF 5 "November 1 2009"
.SH NAME
socks.conf \- socks client configuration file syntax
.SH DESCRIPTION
The configuration file for the socks client library allow control over
logging and server selection.  It is divided into two parts;
global settings and routes.  A line can be commented using the
standard comment character \fB#\fP.
.SH FORMAT
The global settings are in the form of a keyword followed by a colon
and the value.
.TP
\fBdebug\fP
Setting this field to 1 turns on debugging.
.TP
\fBlogoutput\fP
This value controls where the client library sends logoutput.  It can
be either \fBsyslog\fP, \fBstdout\fP, \fBstderr\fP, a filename, or
a combination.  The default is no logging.
.IP \fBresolveprotocol\fP
The protocol used to resolve hostnames.
Valid values are \fBudp\fP, \fBtcp\fP and \fBfake\fP.  The default
is \fBudp\fP.
.IP \fBroute.badexpire\fP
How long the "bad" marking of a route should remain set before
it is removed.  Default is 300 seconds.
.IP \fBroute.maxfail\fP
How many times a route can fail before it is marked as bad.  Default is 1.
.IP \fBtimeout.connect\fP
The number of seconds the client will wait for a connect to the
proxy server to complete.  The default is 0, indicating the client
should use the systems default.
.SH ROUTES
The routes are specified with a \fBroute\fP keyword.
Inside a pair of parenthesis ({}) a set of keywords control the behavior of
the route.
Each \fBroute\fP can contain
three address specifications; \fBfrom\fP, \fBto\fP and \fBvia\fP.
A route is selected for a connection based on the values within the
\fBroute\fP block.

When searching for a route to match the clients request, the library
will first look for a \fBdirect\fP route.  Then for a \fBsocks_v4\fP
route, a \fBsocks_v5\fP route, a \fBhttp\fP route, and lastly
for a \fBupnp\fP route.

Depending on how the library is configured and environment variables
set (see the manual for \fBsocksify(1)\fP), there may or may not be an
automatic fallback to an auto-generated \fBdirect\fP route if no
other route is found.

The \fBroute\fP block can contain the following:

.IP \fBADDRESSES\fP
Each address field can consist of a ipaddress (and where meaningful,
a netmask, separated from the ipaddress by a '\fB/\fP' sign.), a hostname,
a domainname (designated by the leading '\fB.\fP'), or an interfacename
(where meaningful).
Each address can be followed by a optional \fBport\fP specifier.

.IP \fBfrom\fP
The route is used only by requests coming from the address given as value.
.IP \fBto\fP
The route is used only by requests going to the address given as value.
.IP \fBvia\fP
Address of the proxy server that should be used as a gateway for the
connection, or the special value \fBdirect\fP to indicate the connection
should be direct rather than go via any proxy server.

In the case of \fBupnp\fP, it can also be the name of the interface
to use for discovering the upnp controlpoint, if the full url for
the IGD is not yet known.
.IP \fBport\fP
Parameter to \fBfrom\fP, \fBto\fP and \fBvia\fP.  Accepts the keywords
\fBeq/=, ne/!=, ge/>=, le/<=, gt/>, lt/<\fP followed by a number.
A portrange can also be given as "port <start #> - <end #>", which
will match all port numbers within the range <start #> and <end #>.

.TP
.SH Options
.IP \fBclientcompatibility\fP
Enables certain options for compatibility with broken servers.
Valid values are: \fBnecgssapi\fP, for compatibility with servers
implementing gssapi the NEC socks way.
.IP \fBcommand\fP
The server supports the given commands.  Valid commands
are \fBbind\fP, \fBbindreply\fP, \fBconnect\fP, \fBudpassociate\fP
and \fBudpreply\fP.   The default is all commands supported by the
protocols set for the route.

Can be used instead of, or to complement, \fBprotocol\fP.
.IP \fBgssapi.enctype\fP
Which encryption to enforce for GSSAPI-authenticated communication.
Possible values are \fBclear\fP, \fBintegrity\fP, or \fBconfidentiality\fP.
The default is to try for confidentially, but accept whatever the
server offers except \fBclear\fP, as \fBclear\fP is not part of the
SOCKS GSSAPI standard.
.IP \fBgssapi.servicename\fP
Which servicename to use when involving GSSAPI.  Default is "rcmd".

.IP \fBmethod\fP
List of authentication methods the \fBclient\fP supports and which to
offer the server.  Currently supported values are \fBnone\fP, \fBgssapi\fP,
and \fBusername\fP.  The default is all supported methods.
.IP \fBprotocol\fP
The protocols the server supports.
Supported values are \fBtcp\fP and \fBudp\fP.  The default is all
supported protocols.
.IP \fBproxyprotocol\fP
The proxy protocols the server supports.
Currently supported values are \fBsocks_v4\fP, \fBsocks_v5\fP,
\fBhttp\fP, and \fBupnp\fP.  The default is \fBsocks_v4\fP and
\fBsocks_v5\fP.
Note that if the socks server requires any form of authentication, you
need to explicitly set this to to \fBsocks_v5\fP, as v4 does not support
authentication.
.SH EXAMPLES
See the example directory in the distribution.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBSOCKS_USERNAME\fP
Use the value of \fBSOCKS_USERNAME\fP as the username when doing
username authentication.
.TP
\fBSOCKS_PASSWORD\fP
Use the value of \fBSOCKS_PASSWORD\fP as the password when doing
username authentication.  Not recommended as other users on the system
might be able to see your password.
.TP
\fBSOCKS_AUTOADD_LANROUTES\fP
If this variable is set to "no", the client will not try to auto-add
direct routes for all addresses on the lan.  The default is to add
them.
.TP
\fBSOCKS_DISABLE_THREADLOCK\fP
If this variable is set, the client will not perform threadlocking.
The default is for the client to attempt to figure out for itself
whether the application to socksify needs threadlocking or not.
.PP
Some additional environment variables are documented in socksify(1).
